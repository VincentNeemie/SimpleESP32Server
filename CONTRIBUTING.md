Thank you for your interest in contributing!

Guidelines:

- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
- Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- Open a pull request describing your change
- If you add secrets/keys, do NOT commit them. Update `README.md` with instructions to load secrets from `secrets.h` (which is ignored by `.gitignore`).

Simple patches and documentation fixes are welcome.
